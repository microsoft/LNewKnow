# Learning New Knowledge

Welcome to the official repository for our work  **"Uncovering the Inequality in LLM's New Knowledge Learning Across Different Languages"** . This study investigates how LLM learns and transfers new knowledge in multilingual settings, highlighting disparities that may arise during this process.

## üåü Overview

As LLM's influence grows globally, it is crucial to examine how it interacts with diverse languages. This study addresses key questions about fairness and efficiency in multilingual AI systems:

### Research Questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Equally Efficiently?**
Can LLM learn new knowledge with equal efficiency across different languages?

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Equally Transferable?**
Is the newly learned knowledge equally transferable between languages?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Equally Prioritized?**
When conflicting knowledge arises across languages, does LLM prioritize one language over another?

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Equally Resistant?**
Does LLM demonstrate equal resistance to errors while learning new knowledge in different languages?

Through these questions, we aim to reveal hidden disparities in multilingual AI systems and suggest improvements for fostering fairness in AI development.

Learning New Knowledge Code
We developed individual code solutions to address each of our research questions. Corresponding code snippets and instructions for reproducing our experiments are provided below. 

Learning New Knowledge Dataset
The repository contains two datasets: one comprises 100 question-answer pairs generated by an LLM about a future world that is vastly different from the present (e.g., How do schools teach coding in 2038? - Interactive games). This dataset serves as new knowledge for fine-tuning the model. The other dataset includes 50 question-answer pairs (e.g., How many legs does a dog have? - Four), also generated by an LLM, consisting of common knowledge and incorrect answers. This second dataset is designed to study the LLM's resilience to errors in different language environments. 
## üì¶ **Setup**

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ **How to Use**

Below is a detailed explanation of how to run the experiments for each research question, including relevant code snippets and expected outcomes. Each script contains comments to guide you through the process.

### **To Answer Q1 & Q2: Learning and Transferability**

#### **In-context Learning**

Evaluate how LLM learns in one language and transfers knowledge to another.

```
cd src/1.ic_learning # Navigate to the directory for in-context learning
python completion_evaluation.py # Run the script to evaluate knowledge transfer
python parse_results.py # Parse the raw results
python visualization_matrix.py # Visualize the results
python visualization_inequality.py # Plot inequalty trends
```

#### **Finetuning**

Evaluate performance when LLM is finetuned in one language and tested in another.

```
cd ../src/2.ft_learning # Navigate to the directory for finetuning
python evaluation_completion_main.py # Finetune and evaluate
python parse_results.py # Parse the raw results
python visualization_matrix.py # Visualize the results
python visualization_inequality.py # Plot inequalty trends
```

---

### **To Answer Q3: Handling Conflicting Knowledge**

#### **In-context Learning**

Evaluate LLM's behavior when presented with conflicting knowledge across languages.

```
cd ../src/3.ic_conflict # Navigate to the directory for in-context conflict evaluation
python completion_evaluation.py # Run the conflict evaluation
python test_stats.py # Parse the raw results
python aggregation.py # Aggregate the outcomes
python visualization_aggregation.py # Visualize the outcomes
```

#### **Finetuning**

```
cd ../src/4.ft_conflict # Navigate to the directory for finetuning conflict evaluation
python completion_evaluation.py # Run the conflict evaluation
python test_stats.py # Parse the raw results
python aggregation.py # Aggregate the outcomes
python visualization_aggregation.py # Visualize the outcomes
```

---

### **To Answer Q4: Error Resistance**

#### **In-context Learning**

Evaluate LLM's resistance to errors during knowledge acquisition.

```
cd ../src/5.ic_resist # Navigate to the resistance evaluation directory
python completion_evaluation.py # Run the resistance test
python test_stats.py # Parse the raw results
python plot_resist.py # Visualize the results
```

#### **Finetuning**

```
cd ../src/6.ft_resist # Navigate to the resistance evaluation directory
python resist.py # Run the resistance test
python resist_stats.py # Parse the raw results
python fig_plot.py # Visualize the results
```

* Visualization outputs include heatmaps, line plots, and inequality metrics.

## üîç Responsible AI Transparency Information

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Creating a system that is fit for its intended purpose requires an understanding of how the technology works, its capabilities and limitations, and how to achieve the best performance. Microsoft has a broad effort to put our AI principles into practice. To find out more, see [Responsible AI principles from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai).

### Use of this code and dataset

Our goal in publishing this code and dataset is to facilitate reproducibility of our paper in hopes of motivating further research. They are intended to be used by domain experts who are independently capable of evaluating the quality of outputs before acting on them. This code should only be used for research on multilingual LLM. Any real-world applications are beyond the scope of this project.

### Out-of-scope uses
Our assets currently do not support other languages, models, or datasets beyond the specified scope. As a result, if an unskilled user attempts to use them in a context from the limitations, the code will fail to function and will generate an error notification.
### Limitations
We evaluated the model's performance across 17 different languages, as listed below, which suggests that our conclusions may not generalize to other languages:
‚Ä¢	English, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Korean, Swedish, Danish, Tamil, Mongolian, Welsh, Swahili, Zulu, Turkmen, Scottish Gaelic.
Additionally, our study was conducted exclusively on LLMs, meaning the conclusions may not extend to multimodal LLMs or SLMs. Furthermore, our findings are specific to the newly constructed knowledge dataset about the future world and may not apply to other types of knowledge or scenarios.

### Fairness and Responsible AI testing

At Microsoft, we strive to empower every person on the planet to do more. An essential part of this goal is working to create technologies and products that are fair and inclusive. Fairness is a multi-dimensional, sociotechnical topic and impacts many different aspects of our work.

When systems are deployed, Responsible AI testing should be performed to ensure safe and fair operation for the specific use case. No Responsible AI testing has been done to evaluate this method including validating fair outcomes across different groups of people. Responsible AI testing should be done before using this code in any production scenario.
